# Disinformation
OSINT Social Media Data

I wanted a way to track state-sponsored propaganda on reddit and twitter, but couldn't find anything, so I made this. I already know I'm not worthy, so please contribute or send opinions to /dev/null.

# TODO

1. More social media platforms. Facebook, instagram, tumblr, etc?
2. Maybe praw is better than just using requests? I'm liking not needing an API key, but w/e works.
3. ???
4. Democracy.
