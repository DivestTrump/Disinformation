# Disinformation

OSINT Social Media Data

Tracks the spread of (propaganda) domains across social media. Currently searches reddit, twitter and tumblr. It also pulls IP, whois, Google Analytics and AdSense IDs. Probably useful for SEO I suppose. Outputs raw json and an Excel spreadsheet.

# Build

Python 3.6
pip packages: openpyxl, pythonwhois, tweepy

# TODO

1. More social media platforms. YouTube, Facebook, instagram, etc?
2. Maybe praw is better than just using requests? I'm liking not needing an API key, but w/e works.
3. ???
4. Democracy.

# Ways to Help

1. Make the code suck less. 
2. Different outputs: website?
3. More stats. What am I missing?
4. More features. 
5. Find more propaganda sites.
