# Disinformation

OSINT Social Media Data

I wanted a way to track state-sponsored propaganda on reddit and twitter, but couldn't find anything, so I made this. I already know I'm not worthy, so please contribute or send opinions to /dev/null.

# TODO

1. More social media platforms. YouTube, Facebook, instagram, tumblr, etc?
2. Maybe praw is better than just using requests? I'm liking not needing an API key, but w/e works.
3. ???
4. Democracy.

# Ways to Help

1. Make the code suck less. 
2. Different outputs: website?
3. More stats. What am I missing?
4. More features. 
5. More propaganda sites.
